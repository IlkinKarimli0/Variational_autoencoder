# Variational Autoencoder for Image Denoising and Generation
This repository contains the code for a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model that can generate new images and decrease the noise of input images. The VAE model is trained on the MNIST dataset.

# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine using 
`git clone https://github.com/IlkinKarimli0/Variational_autoencoder.git`.
Run the Jupyter Notebook Variational_Autoencoder.ipynb.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to generate new images or decrease the noise of input images.

# Results
The VAE model has been trained on the MNIST dataset and has achieved excellent results. The model can generate new images with a given random latent vector and can decrease the noise of input images. You can find some examples of the generated images in the Jupyter Notebook itself, where they have been plotted.
